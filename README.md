This project is relatively simple. In terms of JavaScript there are just a few lines.
I am adding an event listener to an icon. Once you click on the icon, you toggle the active class. 
The nav container shrinks. The links start to rotate and ultimately disappear setting the opacity to zero.
Then the "X" does a rotation and turns into two lines. You can use this effect in any website or application.
Using mostly CSS. There are quite a few transitions that come into play when you toggle the active class, which happens when you click the icon.
